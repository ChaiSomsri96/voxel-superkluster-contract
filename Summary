1. NFT sale
1-1 List For Sale
    * Seller can set USD price or VXL price to the item when he lists his one.
      The important point is that even if you set the price of NFT to VXL, the price of NFT is based on USD.
      This means VXL token amount that buyer should pay will be changed steadily according to rate between USD and VXL.
    * Seller can also set sale end date.
      After the end of the sale date, the NFT automatically changes to [not for sale] status.
    * Seller can reserve an item to a specific buyer.
      Except this specific buyer, no one else can purchase this item.
    * If seller lists item, seller can find this item under [On Sale] tab in seller profile page.
      This item can be searched when you choose [Buy Now] for SaleType in explorer page.
    * Seller only pays gas fee one time per one collection to approve marketplace and doesn't pay gas fee else.

1-2 Buy Now
    * Buyer can purchase item using vxl tokens.
      But there is an option that buyer can purchase item using eth as well as vxl tokens.
      If you don't hold vxl or ethereum, you won't be able to purchase NFT item.
    * If Nft was created in Superkluster and is first sale, 
      Buyer should pay gas fee for lazymint.

1-3 Offer
    * The buyer may make offer to any items, even if they are [not for sale].
    * Buyer can use only vxl tokens to make offer.
    * Buyer can make offer with amount less than which he holds. 
      If he tries to make an offer for a larger amount, the platform will reject it.
      If he uses a vxl token on another platform to hold a vxl token less than the offer amount, 
      Marketplace automatically deletes his offer.
    * The seller (or NFT holder) can choose one of offers and accept and complete sale.
      In this case , seller pays gas fee for sale transaction.

1-4 Auction (List for auction)
    * Seller lists one item for auction with starting bid price.
      He can set auction period.(auction start date and auction end date)
    * Until auction starts , nobody can't place a bid on item, even though seller lists item for auction.
    * When an auction starts, users must bid at a price greater than the minimum auction price.
    * During auction period, user can cancel his bid.
    * When auction period ends, the bidder who bids max price will become winner.
    * The platform will give 7 days for seller to accept because seller can't accept immediately due to high gas fee or insufficient eth balance.
      If seller doesn't accept winner's bid in first 5 days, winner can pay gas fee to complete his bid for the last 2 days.
      If bid winner really wants to buy this item, he won't hesitate to pay even gas fee.
      So platform will give chance to winner to complete transaction for 2 days.

      When the seller or bid winner completes the auction transaction, the auction is completely over.
      If the seller or bid winner fails to complete the auction transaction for 7 days after the auction ends, the auction will fail and platform 
      will give warning to seller and bid winner.
      This warning will affect their activities in our superkluster marketplace.

1-5 Cart Purchase
    * Platform provides cart for users to save gas fee and buy several items at the same moment in one transaction.
    * User can put only items which are listed for sale.
      And the items also should be erc721 item or erc1155 item with supply quantity 1 per each tokenid.
    * Buyer can purchase items from the cart using vxl token or eth.
